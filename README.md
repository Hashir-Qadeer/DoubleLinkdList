# DoubleLinkdList
A double linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements where each element contains three components:

1. The data or value stored in the element
2. A pointer or reference to the previous element in the sequence
3. A pointer or reference to the next element in the sequence

Here are some key points about double linked lists:

1. Bidirectional traversal: Unlike a singly linked list, a double linked list allows traversal in both forward and backward directions.

2. Structure: Each node in the list contains data and two pointers - one to the previous node and one to the next node.

3. Head and tail: The list typically has pointers to both the first node (head) and the last node (tail) for easy access to both ends.

4. Flexibility: Insertion and deletion operations can be more efficient compared to singly linked lists, especially when inserting or deleting near a given position.

5. Memory usage: Double linked lists use more memory than singly linked lists due to the extra pointer in each node.

6. Common operations: Include insertion (at the beginning, end, or middle), deletion, traversal, and searching.

7. Use cases: They are useful in applications that require frequent forward and backward traversal, like undo/redo functionality in software.

Would you like me to provide a simple implementation of a double linked list in a programming language, or explain any specific aspect in more detail?
